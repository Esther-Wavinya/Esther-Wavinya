### Hello, Nerds ðŸ‘‹

I am Wavinya, nerdy,geeky,cerebral girl. I'm a Geologist(study rocks) by profession but most times you will find my eyes gazing at the laptop or my adds pressing buttons in the keyboard because I love coding. Everything about technology excites me, From developing to developer communities.

I love music. When I'm not coding, I'm somewhere beautiful either a beach,a restaurant,a house,a car, a mountain,a hill, wining or fooding

I choose to have faith, because without that, I have nothingâ€¦ It's the only thing that's keeping me going

You know, we spend so much of our lives not saying the things we want to say, the things we should say. We speak in code and we send little messages
