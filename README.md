### Hello, Nerds ðŸ‘‹

I am Wavinya, nerdy,cerebral girl. I'm a Geologist(study rocks) by profession but most times you will find me with my laptop because I love coding. Everything about technology excites me, From developing to developer communities.

I love music. When I'm not coding, I'm somewhere beautiful either a beach,a restaurant,a house,a car,a mountain,a hill, wining or fooding with family or friends. And when things become overwhelming I love playing video games,watching movies(series),some documentaries and reading technical articles or even writing.



You know, we spend so much of our lives not saying the things we want to say, the things we should say. We speak in code and we send little messages
